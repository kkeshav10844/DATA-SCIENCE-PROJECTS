(“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and sell solar energy generation and energy storage\nproducts. Our Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, there has been a trend in many parts of the world of increasing availability and administration of vaccines\nagainst COVID-19, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, travel and government activities and functions. On the other hand, infection\nrates and regulations continue to fluctuate in various regions and there are ongoing global impacts resulting from the pandemic, including challenges\nand increases in costs for logistics and supply chains, such as increased port congestion, intermittent supplier delays and a shortfall of semiconductor\nsupply. We have also previously been affected by temporary manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments to\nadministrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUnaudited Interim Financial Statements\nThe consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2021, the consolidated statements of operations, the consolidated statements of\ncomprehensive income, the consolidated statements of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity for the three and nine months ended September\n30, 2021 and 2020 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, as well as other information\ndisclosed in the accompanying notes, are unaudited.
